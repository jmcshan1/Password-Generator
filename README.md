# Random Password Generator

## About The Project

This is the webpage for the random password generator. It is very simple, containing a title and a section with a button that will generate and print out a random password. You can give the generated password certain criteria to only contain certain character types of lowercase, uppercase, numerical, and special characters.

In the JavaScript, I wrote a function that takes in the criteria the user inputs and returned a password matching that criteria. The function checks the selected character types and stores every charcter of that type into one variable. Then, in a for loop, the password is generated by randomly taking from that variable and storing it in the generatedPassword variable which is then returned by the function.
